summary: 'Fashion for Metaverse'

abstract: 'The emergence of the metaverse, an immersive digital-physical ecosystem, is becoming a tangible reality. In this interconnected space, facilitated by eXtended Reality (XR), digital virtual humans, akin to human counterparts, engage in diverse activities. The dressing of these digital entities, mapping real-world users, holds significance in reflecting internal and social characteristics. Despite global interest and investments in the "fashion-verse," challenges persist in defining a holistic solution. This special session seeks interdisciplinary discussions on smart solutions for the fashion-verse, exploring XR, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and Internet of Things (IoT) in fashion design, retrieval, modeling, and education.'
